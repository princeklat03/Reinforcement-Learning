# Reinforcement-Learning

Domain –Logistics
focus –Optimal path

**Business challenge/requirement**
BluEx is a leading logistics company in India. It's known for efficient delivery of packets to customers. However BluEx is facing a challenge where its vandrivers are taking a suboptimal path for delivery. This is causing delays and higher fuel cost.

You as ML expert have to create a ML model using Reinforcement Learning so that efficient path is found through the program

**Considerations**
Reinforcement Learning is tricky,so the expectation is to come up with sample flow and full-fledged implementation will be done by team later

**Business benefits**
Up to 15% fuelcost can be saved by taking optimal path

The pathway from source to destination is given by image below:
